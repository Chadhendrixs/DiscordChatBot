# DiscordChatBot
This is a Python3 chat bot designed to work with a TensorFlow NMT-ChatBot deployment.

## Installation

```git clone https://https://github.com/Chadhendrixs/DiscordChatBot```

Enter your [NMT-ChatBot](https://github.com/daniel-kukiela/nmt-chatbot) directory, create a deployment, and copy it into the DiscordChatBot/ directory. (Do NOT change its name.)

## Usage

```
cd DiscordChatBot
pip3 install -r required.txt
echo "DISCORD_TOKEN={your_token_here}" > .env
python3 __init__.py
```

This should be all that is required to begin with the ChatBot.
